## Starting Thoughts
- Download the data from the URL provided
  - https://eccdn.com.au/misc/challengedata.json
- Create an data object for the downloaded data. 
- Store the data in a map for the time being.
- Load the data from resources at startup.
- Create a Map based repository for querying/storing the data.

### Spring Time!!!
- Time for some web framework. I have selected Spring, only because it is easy to use...debatable said the newbie :)
